# calculator
Project is to make a working calculator within the browser using CSS, HTML and JS. 
Seen some projects that aren't very nice to look at, so want something nice and clean. Initial thought is to look at the windows os calculator as inspiration. 

*Challenge so far whilst making my grid - found I was overdoing it trying to make it sit how I wanted, so went over grid again to get it right.
