# calculator
Project is to make a working calculator within the browser using CSS, HTML and JS. 
Seen some projects that aren't very nice to look at, so want something nice and clean. Initial thought is to look at the windows os calculator as inspiration. 

*Challenge so far whilst making my grid - found I was overdoing it trying to make it sit how I wanted, so went over grid again to get it right. 

A tough project in the end that had its bumps, having spent some time away from JS in between to look at PHP for a potential opportunity. 
Managed to make a basic calculator which is relatively aesthetically pleasing.

Pros 
- Revisited switch statements and grids, good to brush up on this
- styling is strong, learned a few new tricks with this project

cons - 
Would've liked to have the operator display in previous input when calculating sums
In future I would've liked to look into keyboard support
